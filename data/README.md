# data

As you download the repo and run the notebooks for the tutorials and homeworks, the datasets will get saved to this folder.

Below are enumerated the datasets we'll be using in week 1.

## Housing prices dataset

- Tutorial 1
- Homework 2

## SUSY dataset

- Used for Tutorial 3

## MNIST

-  Homework 2
-  Tutorial 4

You can download the MNIST dataset by clicking on the link below:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEKzfmEu6WKdRlohBQiqi3PhW_uIVJVP/view?usp=sharing

Afterwards, you either have to modify the data path in the notebooks to point to your downloads directory - Or you copy and paste the downloaded `MNIST_CSV` directory to `block-course-feb25-ML/data`.


## Other science datasaets

Homework 5 is a "concept integration" project.

You're free (and encouraged) to use a dataset from your own research or personal project, but, in case you'd like some classic "science" to get started with, here are some examples of some ``classic datasets'' to work with if you'd like inspiration.

**Particle physics:**

We're excited to see what you come up with? Your class project could even become your first ML paper üòç
