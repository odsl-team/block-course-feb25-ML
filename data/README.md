## Other science datasaets

Homework 5 is a "concept integration" project.

You're free (and encouraged) to use a dataset from your own research or personal project, but, in case you'd like some classic "science" to get started with, here are some examples of some ``classic datasets'' to work with if you'd like inspiration.

**Particle physics:**
- Jet classificaiton:
- Drell Yann:
- Calo challenge:
- 
**Astrophysics:**
- Galaxies dataset
- Gravitational waves

**Chemistry:**
- QM9


We're excited to see what you come up with? Your class project could even become your first ML paper üòç
